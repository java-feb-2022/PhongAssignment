Week 4- like go to server/unlike goes back to server.
-Sorting. takes time and there's traffic
-can't keep everything in session
-there's always a page refreshing


***No more controller/JSP
manage state? have different front end and back end?
request --react front end ---call rest controller/route everytime 
**rest controller - auth/create user -- expose to outside world
***rest Controller- json format data 

**zoo animal api
